# What is Element Manager?
**Element Manager** is a powerful and lightweight server management plugin for **Minecraft**. It provides essential features for server administrators, such as automatic restart functionality, configuration management, and more.

This plugin allows for easy management of server settings and ensures your server stays running smoothly with auto-restart capabilities. The plugin is designed to work with both **Bukkit** and **Paper** servers.

## Features

- **Automatic Server Restart**: Automatically restarts your Minecraft server based on the settings in the `config.yml` file.
- **Easy Configuration**: Manage server settings like memory allocation, server jar file, and GUI options through a simple `config.yml`.
- **Folder and File Management**: Automatically creates the `management` folder and the `config.yml` file upon first run.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works across all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) with tailored commands for each.
- **Log and Backup Management**: Easily manage backups and logs with auto-created directories.

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of **Element Manager** from the [releases](https://github.com/yourusername/ElementManager/releases) page.
2. Place the `.jar` file in the **plugins** folder of your **Minecraft** server.
3. Start your server. The plugin will automatically create a `management` folder and a `config.yml` file if they do not already exist.
4. Configure the settings in the `config.yml` file as per your needs.

## Configuration

The plugin creates a `config.yml` file in the `management` folder on first run. Here is an example of the default configuration:

```yaml
options:                      # Server Options
  auto-restart: true          # If enabled, it will automatically restart the server after it is stopped
  auto-logging: true          # If enabled, it will automatically log the chat messages sent by players
logging:                      # Logging Options
  chat:                       # Chat Logging Options
    enabled: true             # If true, the plugin will automatically log chat messages sent by the player
    forbidden:                # Add banned words to your servers (e.g. swearing, bad words). You can find out which players wrote these messages by examining the logs.
      - word1
      - word2
      - word3
tasks:                        # New Feature! Custom Task Options
  test:                       # This is the name of your task, make sure it's unique
    enabled: true             # If false, this task will not be run.
    interval: 10              # Enter the time interval at which your task will run (e.g. 10 means 10 seconds)
    file: test.command        # The file containing your commands, you can create as many as you want, make sure it is located in `tasks/`. You can enter any command you want on each line.
  another_task:               # Another task
    enabled: true             # Enabling task
    interval: 5               # This task will run at 5 second intervals
    file: any_name.command    # This tasks commands are in any_name.command
server:                       # Server Properties
  jar: "server.jar"           # Name of the server JAR file
  memory: 4096                # The memory that your server uses (e.g. 4096MB = 4GB)
  gui: false                  # If enabled, server starts with a GUI
```

## New Feature! Custom Task Options
### What are these "Custom Tasks"?
Special tasks are commands that run on the server at specific intervals.

### How to add Custom Tasks
First open the `tasks` folder inside the `management` folder in your server's main directory, create any file you want inside, but I recommend the `*.command` format. Now write the commands you want to run in your file in order. For example, a `test.command` example:
```command
say Hello
tp @a 0 0 0
```

The commands are exactly the same as minecraft commands. Now let's configure these commands in `management/config.yml`:
```yaml
#...
tasks:
  # ...
  test:
    enabled: true
    interval: 10
    file: test.command
# ...
```
Now `say Hello` and `tp @a 0 0 0` will run every 10 seconds! Yes, that was all.
